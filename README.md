# About
This project was created as part of a coding challenge. The content has been anonymized to respect confidentiality.


- improve pagination with fastapi-sqla
- add sorting to endpoint
- use alembic for datamigration

## Task 2
Implement the following API endpoints which use the model / database:

- /api/v1/measurements/ : Retrieve ( GET ) a list of measurements for a given
user_id , filter by start and stop timestamps (optional). This endpoint
should support pagination, sorting, and a way to limit the number of measurements returned.
